    <h2>my current state of the website</h2>
    <p>
      in the current way, i think i like where my website is evolving and i think i narrowed down some principles about
      my blog, which i want to share.
    </p>
    <h3>minimalistic but creative</h3>
    <p>
      first of all i want it to be minimalistic. i don`t want it to be overloaded like many websites in the current
      internet are, but that`s another topic for it`s self. on the other hand i want this website also to be a creative
      project for me. i want to tinker and experiment with the design and code. but i will try to keep the balance. on
      the one hand minimalism and creativity on the other hand.
    </p>
    <h3>my code, my freedom</h3>
    <p>
      i also want the website to be mine. to be my project. so i will try to copy as less as possible. normaly at the
      start of a new web-project, the first thing i will do is installing bootstrap, the most popular css framework. at
      the beginning of this website i really asked myself: do i wanna use bootstrap? but shortly after that i started to
      realise: do i really need it? it is worth the code bloat that comes with it? and perhaps the most important
      question: do i want to use these predefined classes and layouts? i like bootstrap, don`t get me wrong. it is so
      easy to build nice and responsive websites with it, but the reason why i don`t want to use it on this website is:
      it leads to a lack of creative freedom and i don`t want it. so i don`t want to use it, as well as any other kind
      of framework or template builder. i want most of the code to be written directly by me, not to be copied from a
      framework or codepen or something like that.
    </p>
    <h3>(independent) design and border madness</h3>
    <p>
      with the design i want to be independent as well. but to be honest i a good designer, i am more a coder, so i have
      to look for inspiration on other websites. one website that inspired me for my first draft was <a
        href="https://suboptimalism.neocities.org/">suboptimalism<span class="icon"></span></a> cause i really like
      this style. this visible borders reminds me a bit of neo brutalism web design. so i wanted to try it by myself and
      really overshot it. i made a border for every visible element and i think it was just too much. although i also
      believe that the generall idea was not that bad. but then instead of experimenting with borders, i completely
      turned them off. maybee i will give them a second try in some time.
    </p>
    <h3>unique spin and linux vibes</h3>
    <p>
      one thing that i want to achieve with my design for this website is to have a creative and unique spin to it. i
      came up with the idea of a kind of linux home file managment as my navigation. I then thought why not building the
      website completely to kind of mimic a file manager, so i did it and i really like how its turned out. after that i
      found <a href="https://wiredphantom.neocities.org/navi">wiredphantom<span class="icon"></span></a> and thought:
      ok my idea was not that unique as i thought, but wiredphantom has a very diffrent approach to it than my site, so
      i think it`s okay. by the way i also very much like the idea and the implementation of wiredphantom.
    </p>
    <p>
      so i really like the idea of this linux file manager vibe. on the other hand i am quite not sure if it`s
      userfriendly enough, but i think at the moment it is ok.
    </p>
    <h3>copy-and-paste-hell and one way to reduce it</h3>
    <p>
      nevertheless it also made me a bit of headache at some point, because i have a bit more html-files than usual,
      especially for the start of a website. this is not a big problem but especially at the beginning where the whole
      structure and code of the website is not finished and changes frequently it is a bit annoying. particularly if you
      just copy the exact code from one place to 5 different files.
    </p>
    <p>
      for example my left side-navigation, if i were coding in php or with javascript, i would have created a module for
      this, to only have to maintain it in one place or file, but in html there is no module feature yet. therefore, i
      decided to write a bash script to automate or mimic this.
    </p>
    <p>
      it is really just a small script, still now i can use kind of html-modules. in a html file for example i now can
      write "@include-nav.html" and this bash script will then look for nav.html in my modules directory and will copy
      the code to this exact place. and it does that not for a single file, it checks all of my html-files in a
      specified directory. it also copies all the files to a separate directory with the right modules attached. so in
      the end i have a directory with html files i can use and upload alongside a working directory where i can work
      with html modules. i will not get into the details, cause i plan to upload the script to github and link it on my
      website, as well as i want to share the whole source code on github. it now saves me a lot of headaches and time,
      even though i am just using it for two modules yet.
    </p>
    <h3>javascript and the magic of css</h3>
    <p>
      but as i said i currently don`t want to use javascript on this website at all. to keep things simple and
      minimalistic. i also want to make it a bit of a challenge for me. with css and html there is so much you can do.
      more than you would think of. for example i most recently added a responsive navigation menu for mobile devices,
      which you can open and close via a so called hamburger menu (the tree bars). normally it would be very easy to do
      with javascript. you just add some javascript lines which toggles certain classes on the navigation elements.
      thats it. but without javascript it is getting a bit tricky, but not impossible. it envolves a little trick with
      the input type checkbox and some smart css selectors. but i won`t get into details here either, because it would
      be too much for this post. if you wanna know how it`s done, i may write a web dev blog post about it. i just wanna
      to give you an example of stuff you can do by just using html and css. for more examples i would recommend to you
      to look at the <a href="https://100dayscss.com/">100 days css challenge<span class="icon"></span></a>. it`s a
      website that gives you 100 challenges to recreate but only with html and css. even though many people use a bit of
      javascript as well, you could do it without javascript at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      i also want to avoid javascript because there are people who disable javascript in there browsers, because of
      different reasons. mainly because of privacy concerns. and even though i am not doing it, i can relate to it. so i
      want to create a website that is exactly the same even if you decide to turn of javascript. and to give the
      shoutout i think it was <a href="https://eldritchdata.neocities.org/">eldritchdata<span class="icon"></span></a>
      that inspired me to this. a website that you only can read if you disable javascript. i did not read that much yet
      from this site yet, but i definitely want to look closer at the guides.
    </p>
    <p>so i think thats it for the moment. </p>

    <p>welcome to part two of my linuxjourney. i highly recommend you to read the <a href="/home/sidethoughts/linux/linux_journey_part_one.html">first part</a>, because this part will continue right
      after that.</p>
    <h2>to arch or not to arch</h2>
    <p>after i installed arch on my daily laptop, i really got to know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">linux</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      and especially <a href="https://archlinux.org/">arch linux</a>
      @include-icon/arch.html
      . this system, i
      don`t remember it quite that good, but i think i have managed to keep it stable and not to break it. i am not
      sure. it was some time ago. but for sure i did not update it it regularly, as i <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_maintenance#Upgrading_the_system">should</a>
      @include-icon/arch.html
      have. on the other hand, i
      had quite some issues with some stuff working not correctly, that i fixed time after time. one thing that was the
      not working at first was bluetooth for sure, but i believe with the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page">arch wiki</a>
      @include-icon/arch.html
      i have made it work. i invested a
      decent amount of time to fix such issues, so that i did not even try to get printing via <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CUPS">cups</a>
      @include-icon/arch.html
      to work. nowadays i know how to fix these issues, or to better say i know that i can fix these issues very quickly and i where to find
      useful resources to do so. but at this point in time i had basically no experience with linux at all. the only os
      i have used was windows and sometimes i used mac-os in my school (and my work-laptop came with pre-installed
      arch). so i was used that certain things just work out of the box. i would also say that it was a mistake to jump
      right into arch linux and not to have a better start with distros like <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">linux mint</a> 
      @include-icon/mint.html
      or <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">fedora</a>
      @include-icon/fedora.html
      .</p>
    <p>at the end i just wanted to get back to arch linux. nowadays i would have wished to at least have experienced
      fedora or a <a href="https://www.debian.org/index.en.html">debian</a>
      @include-icon/debian.html
      (based) distro other than <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">ubuntu</a>
      @include-icon/ubuntu.html
      or even debian itself, but i got back to arch. like i said it
      was mainly cause of the minimal and freedom <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux">philosophy</a>
      @include-icon/arch.html
      , but to be honest i think it was also due to the fact that
      arch was hyped. i also liked the memes about arch (e.g. <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch">btw i use arch</a>
      @include-icon/external.html
      ) and thought that cool "linux-kids"
      naturally use arch. it was and is hyped in some parts of the linux-community and i naively thought that there are
      good reasons for it. of course, there are but this is not entirely true, i know nowadays. everybody should use the
      distro that fits them the most. for one it is arch, for others it`s fedora or linux mint or even <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">gentoo</a>
      @include-icon/gentoo.html
      . on the
      other hand because of the fact that my work-laptop was also on arch linux, i was used to it, so i thought it would
      be better to go back so that i don`t have to learn a new distro all over again next to my web-dev-apprenticeship
      and my volunteering stuff i did in my free time. i also didn`t want to do the arch install all over again, so i
      looked for a arch-based-distro and right at this time <a href="https://garudalinux.org/">garuda linux</a>
      @include-icon/garuda.html
      was getting popular. it`s an arch-based-distro,
      which is costumized for gaming with a lot of visual features out of the box. i didn`t think that this was in
      conflict to my minimal approach and also my hardware capabilities. my thinkpad <a href="https://thinkwiki.de/T440s">t440s</a>
      @include-icon/external.html
      with my 12 gb ram was not that good enough for so many visual effects. also, because of the customization for gaming, it comes with a lot of
      pre-configuration. i think i tried <a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/">kde plasma</a>
      @include-icon/kde.html
      in garuda, and i didn`t like that either. so after a week or so,
      maybe it was even shorter. i looked for an alternative and i found <a href="https://endeavouros.com/">endeavour-os</a>
      @include-icon/endeavouros.html
      . a minimal arch-based distro which
      comes close to vanilla arch. i think i also tried <a href="https://www.xfce.org/">xfce</a>
      @include-icon/xfce.html
      , but again i am not sure. at some point a tried it for
      sure, but maybe it was only in a <a class="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">virtual system</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      .</p>
    <h3>endeavour-os</h3>
    <p>at the end i ended up with endeavour-os and <a href="https://www.gnome.org/en/">gnome</a>
      @include-icon/gnome.html
      for a long time. i liked my current system and for sure i was a
      fan of gnome with the workflow and apps it ships. on the other hand i had much more trouble with this set-up than
      i had with my very first arch install. maybe it is just a nostalgic thing, but i do think that my very first setup
      was much more stable than my endeavour-os setup. on this setup i remember i had quite some issues to fix and my
      system broke completely from time to time. sometimes it was my fault, but on rare occasions it was endeavour-os
      itself who caused it to break. i remember once after an update i could not get back into my system and i was
      really scared, because i thought i lost everything. after some investigation on my work-laptop i found the issue
      on the <a href="https://forum.endeavouros.com/">forum</a>
      @include-icon/endeavouros.html
      of endeavour-os and it was not my fault, instead it was entirely the fault of endeavour-os (read about it <a href="https://endeavouros.com/news/full-transparency-on-the-grub-issue/">here</a>
      @include-icon/endeavouros.html
      ). there was
      a known bug that caused <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB">grub</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      to fail, so grub had to be updated or reinstalled manually. in short grub is a
      bootloader which manages the boot process. after some nervous moments i managed to fix this issue. so in the end
      everything was ok, but i had a bad time with a lot of fear during the process. this bug only appeared in
      endeavour-os system`s so a normal arch install would have spared me this moment. although i think i got stronger
      after that because i came to the conclusion even when certain things break completely i can handle it, i can fix
      it. on the other hand i was more careful with updates, so that i only updated my system if i had time to fix
      possible issues afterwards. it is a good recommendation to do this, but this led for me to update my system even
      more unregularly in other words even lesser. and because of this more issues came along. most of them were easy to
      fix. the issue that i encountered the most was problems with the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Package_signing#Managing_the_keyring">arch key ring</a>
      @include-icon/arch.html
      or the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mirrors">mirrorlist</a>
      @include-icon/arch.html
      , which i then had to update manually again. now i am foreshadowing: currently i am not using arch nearly a year at this moment and i
      forgot certain arch things. and even though i had to fix this issue quite regularly, i don`t remember exactly what
      i did. so at the moment i can`t explain more to this topic.</p>
    <p>from time to time a looked at other distros, but i did not install them. i was just informing about them and
      trying to keep up to date with the linux community. yeah, it was also a bit of looking for alternative systems,
      but i did not remember to really thought about hopping to another distro. i was happy with endeavour. at some
      point i tried a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">window tiling manager</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      , <a href="https://openbox.org/">openbox</a>
      @include-icon/external.html
      i think, in a virtual machine, but again foreshadowing, i was not
      ready to leave a full desktop environment yet.</p>
    <p>in august of 2023 i bought a new laptop. surprisingly it was nearly exact 4 years later than i bought my thinkpad
      t440s. around that time i started to study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work">social work</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      and i wanted a better laptop for the start of my studies.
      but i had not quite the money to buy the newest tech and i wanted to stay on a thinkpad, because i had no
      mentionable issue with the t440s, besides the battery (it is not that good as it used to be, so i couldn´t use my
      laptop that long without recharging). i still have it and use it from time to time to test stuff. but it was
      getting older, after all it was made in 2014. so it at this time it was nearly 10 years old, 9 years to be
      exactly. now it is 12 years old and i can still use it quite good. but i wanted an upgrade. in the end i bought
      which in some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/">thinkpad-linux communities</a>
      @include-icon/reddit.html
      is praised as the "goat" (greatest of all time) of thinkpads or at least the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zY5anXUTfI">last great thinkpad</a>
      @include-icon/youtube.html
      , the
      thinkpad <a href="https://thinkwiki.de/T480">t480</a>
      @include-icon/external.html
      with 16 gb of ram. and i think it was a good decision. now, after 2 years (and some months) i still
      love my thinkpad. it is not the best device, but other than some compromises about gaming the newest games, it`s
      more than enough for my use case and everything can be exchanged or upgraded. in general thinkpads are made very
      robust and last a long time. again i installed endeavour on it and i was using it at least for a year on this
      machine.</p>
    <p>sadly i don`t recall other dates before this buying date. i would love to know the exact dates of the time i
      installed arch for the first time, as well as the other moments i mentioned in this post, like my ubuntu time,
      garuda linux and the start of my endeavour-os-phase. but i don`t think i have much clues to determine this dates.
      maybe i will dive deeper into it and try to make a kind of timetable.</p>
    <p>with my new thinkpad i did not change much. i looked around for other distros and desktops but i never seriously
      considered to move.</p>
    <p>up until my second semester in summer 2024. at this time i worked at my university in the website-team of my
      department and i had a cool boss. to be correct formally it was my boss, but we were more like a team and we saw
      each other more like teammates, even though there were obviously a hierarchy and a dependency between us.
      especially when i participated in his seminars. in this semester (summer 2024) he made a seminar about free and
      open source software (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">foss</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      ), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright">copyright</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      and linux. the final submission of these course was an installation of
      linux, the presentation of it and a documentation of the whole process. i really liked the course, because it was
      the first time i really get to know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement">free software movement</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      and my professor showed us linux very beginner-friendly. of course, most of it i already knew, because at this point in time i used linux already 3-4
      years. so i wasn`t a beginner anymore and in some topics i had more knowledge than my professor, but it was a good
      refreshment, and some aspects were new for me for example the dual boot, i never did one. it was also a good way
      to learn linux all over again, this time more systematically from the ground and also with a progressive political
      point of view in mind. in my apprenticeship we also had an introduction to linux at the vocational school, but it
      was intended to learn linux for servers and it was only the technical side of view. not the history nor something
      political. we had to install a server on our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">raspberry pi`s</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      and develop a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">python</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      sensor program, which measured the temperature and the humidity. i don´t remember that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project">gnu-project</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      was even mentioned once. it was more influenced by the liberal economic side of view, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_movement">open-source ideology</a>
      @include-icon/wikipedia.html
      .</p>
    <p>ok, back to my linux-seminar at the university. there i really considered which linux distro i want to install
      and present at my old thinkpad. first of course i thought about arch linux. in the seminar our professor gave us
      time to research and to install distros during the seminar and i wanted to use this time. so it was clear that i
      should not do an arch install. on the other hand i could have invested the time to do a normal arch install and
      really get to know my system. but i started to wonder if i could use this seminar to experience and test a
      completely new distro, maybe also a challenging one. and so i did...</p>
    <p>i think at this point i would like to stop and make a little cliff hanger out of it, i feel a bit sorry for that,
      but just a little bit, not enough to not do it. i think it is a good point to stop here because the next part is a
      key point in my linux journey which changed a lot. so i would like to give it its own part. and i think i will
      write it very soon, because it will help me to decide if i wanna stay at this distro or if i want to go back to
      arch linux. i think this question was the whole reason why i started to write about my linuxjourney. i wanted to
      reflect on why i did what in which time to help me to understand what i should do next. so there will be hopefully
      not a big break, although i am currently thinking about adding a big feature to my bash-html-builder-script, which
      can take some time, but this is a topic of it`s self. and i am currently stuck on my last assignment this semester
      which i should really be focusing on more.</p>
    <p>but for the time being that is all i have to say</p>

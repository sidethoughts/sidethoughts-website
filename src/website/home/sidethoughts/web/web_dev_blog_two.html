    <h2>some changes, visible and not visible </h2>
    <p>
      this is part two of my web dev blogs. so if you have not read <a
        href="/home/sidethoughts/web/web_dev_blog_one">web_dev_blog_one.html</a> i would highly recommand it to you
      because it is a follow-up-post, and i will reference things from the part one.
    </p>
    <p>
      in the last couple of days i changed a lot on my website, but more stuff in the background and workflow. so most
      of the changes are not visible for you, except for the elephant in the room: my color switch, but i will get to
      this later on.
    </p>
    <h3>accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      first of all in my last web dev blog i forgot one
      important principle: web accessibility. of course this is also an aspect that is important to me, to make the web
      inclusive.
      so first i checked how my website currently is in regards to accessibility. i did it with the browser-extension <a
        href="https://silktide.com/toolbar/">silktide accessibility checker</a>
      @include-icon/external.html
      which i found on the <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/#browser-extensions"> resources page</a>
      @include-icon/external.html
      from <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">the a11y project</a>
      @include-icon/external.html
      and it was okay for the start, but not perfect, if a website even can be perfectly accessible.
    </p>
    <h3>icons</h3>
    <p>
      the first thing i improved was the icons. currently i am using icons to display that a link is an external link
      and in some cases also to which website it is linking. by the way i am doing this to make clear whenever you are
      leaving my
      website. not because i don`t want you to check out other stuff. i want you to do exactly this, but i want to make
      clear that i cannot assure that your privacy is handled safely on other websites, especially on commercial
      website. the first approach of this was not very
      accessibility friendly for screen readers. so now i ended up creating two span elements for the icons. one with
      the icon inside, which is hidden for screen
      reader via aria-hidden. the other one has a text in it which describes the icon. this one got a font-size of zero
      to only be visible for the screen reader. i only tested it with the built-in screen reader in the
      browser-extension i already talked about. so at the moment i hope it is fine for other screen readers as well.
    </p>
    <h3>label issues</h3>
    <p>
      next i fixed some label issues. the obvious one of course was the input button for my responsive navigation menu.
      but there also were some issues with my link labeling. in most of the pages due to my design that mimics a linux
      file system there are links which just say "/". obviously the extension won`t know why i have links like that on
      my
      page. to fix this i added an aria-label to it.
    </p>
    <h3>html-semantic</h3>
    <p>
      i also found some minor semantic problems, which i mostly fixed. i usually try to make my html as semantically
      correct
      as possible, at least according to the basic requirements. but i still have some semantic issues i need to fix.
      but all headlines should be semantically correct and i try to not overuse div-elemnts. in the future i should also
      work on stuff like using the article-element, which i currently don`t use at all. but for this i need to read more
      about
      the correct semantic of a website. i also need to improve my website titles. at the moment there are all the same
      which isn`t that good.
    </p>
    <h3>readability</h3>
    <p>
      after that i added a line-height of 1.5 to all p-elements (paragraph) to ensure better readability. for an even
      better
      readability i also changed the font on long texts to <a href="https://opendyslexic.org/">opendyslexic</a>
      @include-icon/external.html
      in the mono variant. opendyslexic is an open source font, which increases readability especially for readers with
      dyslexia, but i think it improves readability in generell and i think this is more important than design.
    </p>
    <h3>design improvements</h3>
    <p>
      other than the accessibility features i also did some minor improvements to the design. first of all i switch my
      color theme from a light theme to a dark. i am basically using the same colors like i did before but each
      exchanged with each other.
      and i also improved the hover-link-color for a slightly different orange. in addition to that i
      also added an option in my files module to move on up in the file-hierarchie. so now you can also go directly to
      the parent directory. other than that i only did some minor changes.
    </p>
    <h3>open source the source code</h3>
    <p>
      last but not least i changed my "workflow", or to better say my way of uploading my files to neocities,
      completely.
      at my last web_dev_blog i mentioned that i want to upload my source code to github, but to be excact correct i did
      not do
      this until today. i started a github repository, but i uploaded my website code after it was build by my bash
      script. yesterday and today i decided to change that because of two reasons.
    <p>
      first i wanna show you my real source code so that you can see my way of working with modules.<br /> secondly i
      also thought
      about why did i saved the files in git in the first place. to version it, to source control it and also to back up
      it. so than i should upload the source code and not the build files.
    </p>
    <h3>my new github workflow</h3>
    <p>
      i also stumbled about the idea of using
      github actions to deploy to code directly to neocities. so this morning i completly change my file structure to
      upload the source code. then i also edit my building prozess (build.sh) to the correct directory paths and change
      some small issues for the deployment pipeline. if you want to know more about github actions in generell you can
      look it up in <a
        href="https://github.blog/enterprise-software/ci-cd/build-ci-cd-pipeline-github-actions-four-steps/">github`s
        blog</a>
      @include-icon/github.html
      . to summarize the result of the github deployment for my website very quickly: now whenever i change a file in my
      <a href="https://github.com/sidethoughts/sidethoughts-website">website github repository </a>
      @include-icon/github.html
      a so called github workflow is automatically triggered. this workflow builds my html files with my bash-script
      and upload these files directly to neocities. for this it uses the <a
        href="https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities">deploy-to-neocities</a>
      @include-icon/github.html
      action from <a href="https://github.com/bcomnes">bcomnes</a>
      @include-icon/github.html
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      maybee i have overcomplicated it. i mean it kind of gets in conflict with my minimalistic approach, but on the
      other hand it is now so much easier and faster.

    </p>
    <h3>shell-html-builder</h3>
    <p>
      in my shell-html-builder i also made some changes before that. i now can use modules inside of modules, which i
      currently use for icons and i also fixed some minor bugs in the script.
    </p>
    <p>
      yeah, i think these should be all the main changes i did in the last couple of days

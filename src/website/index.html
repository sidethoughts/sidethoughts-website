    <h2>still work in progress</h2>
    <p>this is the first draft of this page. so it is not responsive nor will everything stay as it is.</p>
    <p>i am also really unsure about the current style of this website, but i also don`t want to copy from other
      websites. i want to have my own style as much as possible</p>
    <p>as well as the current structure. so it will be very chaotic at the beginning, but i want to post the first stuff
      nonetheless. see this as an act against perfectionism!</p>
    <h3>stay tuned!</h3>
    <p>things i want to include or write about</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(digital) minimalism</li>
      <li>linux and coding</li>
      <li>personal blog</li>
      <li>queer stuff mainly aspec* related</li>
      <li>(left) political stuff and theory</li>
